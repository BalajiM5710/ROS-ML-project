# ROS-ML-project


An innovative waste sorting system for airports aims to enhance waste management practices by implementing a smart bin system using OpenCV, a popular computer vision library. By analyzing real-time video footage captured by a camera fixed on the bin, the system utilizes OpenCV to identify the material type of the waste, such as plastic, glass, food waste, or metal. This information is then used to efficiently sort the waste into the appropriate bins, thereby improving waste management and reducing the amount of recyclable material sent to landfills. Machine learning algorithms, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), are employed to classify waste items into specific categories, activating the corresponding compartments in the bins. The system's performance will be assessed based on accuracy, speed, and reliability, with the goal of minimizing manual sorting efforts and promoting environmentally friendly waste disposal practices.

And, This a team project.
